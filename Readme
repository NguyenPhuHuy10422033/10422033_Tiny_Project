# Tiny Project Testing Guide #
PART A:
- A1 (run mainVector.exe)
g++ main_vector.cpp Vector.cpp -o mainVector
mainVector.exe
OUTPUT:
Vector v1: 1 2 3
Vector v2 = v1 * 2: 2 4 6
Vector v3 = v1 + v2: 3 6 9
Vector v4 = v3 - v1: 2 4 6
Dot product v1 * v2 = 28

- A2 (run testMatrix.exe)
g++ Matrix.cpp main_matrix.cpp -o testMatrix
testMatrix.exe
Output:
Matrix A:
1 2 
3 4 

Matrix B:
5 6 
7 8 

A + B:
6 8 
10 12 

A * B:
19 22 
43 50 

- A3 (run solveSystem.exe)
g++ Vector.cpp Matrix.cpp LinearSystem.cpp main_linear.cpp -o solveSystem
solveSystem.exe
Output:

Solving Ax = b using Conjugate Gradient (symmetric A):
-0.0232558 1.67442 1.2093

- A4 (run leastSquares.exe)
g++ Vector.cpp Matrix.cpp LinearSystem.cpp LeastSquaresSolver.cpp main_leastsquares.cpp -o leastSquares
leastSquares.exe
Output:
